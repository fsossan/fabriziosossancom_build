## Traverse Jungfraujoch - Loetschental, 29 May 2023
Traversee from Jungfraujoch to Loetschental. That's the end of an excellent ski-touring season! With G.'s skies. Short detour to avoid a thin snow brigde over huge crevasse (while we have seen others passing). Saw someone coming down from the north face of Aletschorn with about 5 turns in total... amazing!

## Bietschhorn ridge SE-N, 9-11 Jul 2023 
From Baltschiederklause to Bietschhorn Hutte through the summit, in 14 hours. Nice climb on the way up; descend never ends. Started at 5:00, summit at 10:30, at the shelter at 19:00. In the glacier, ended up in the water until the knee. Traversee on the snow was good. Climb up efficient. On the way down, found a lot of snow and frozen patches, had to protect a lot in these places.

## Val Ferret, 14 Jul 2023
A few days clmibing on the granite of Val Ferret. Stayed in the busy and moderately dirty winter room of Dalmazzi. My questions ("*scusi, ma il Dalmazzi e' aperto?*", "*il locale invernale del Dalmazzi e' tenuto bene?*") to literally everyone in Courmayeur are now legendary. Climbs: La Beresina, Les chamois volants (with its amazing 17 rappels) on Monts Rouges de Triolet, Genepi (Parete dei Titani), and il gatto e la volpe (without headwall).
